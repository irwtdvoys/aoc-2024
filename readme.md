## Notes

##### Day 01

Nice and simple, didn't bother to implement negative numbers for the difference as the data was all positive.

##### Day 02

Reused difference code from day 1, caught the double number start issue before it happened ;)

##### Day 03

REGEX!

##### Day 04

Just ran a quick search for the start and middle of the x characters, just had to be careful to avoid overflowing the edge.

##### Day 05

Tried a very naive bruteforce before attempting a tree based on the rules. In the end used simpler trees after filtering for relevant rules and then running a DFS.

##### Day 06

Kept track of all directions taken through a space in a hash map to detect loops. Ran for each visited space from part 1 and counted loops detected. Further optimised to not recalculate the start of the path each time.

##### Day 07

Tough one. Struggled with issues on non-test data so rewrote working in reverse.

##### Day 08

Nice and straight forward. Part two just needed a loop.

##### Day 09

Struggled with part 2 today. Tried a Doubly linked List which worked on the test data but was very slow. Changed tactic to a list of files and spaces. It works but still takes almost a minute...  

##### Day 10

Recursive Depth First Search. Returned a list of end points reached with each path. Counted unique for part 1 and all of them for part 2.
