## Notes

##### Day 01

Nice and simple, didn't bother to implement negative numbers for the difference as the data was all positive.

##### Day 02

Reused difference code from day 1, caught the double number start issue before it happened ;)

##### Day 03

REGEX!

##### Day 04

Just ran a quick search for the start and middle of the x characters, just had to be careful to avoid overflowing the edge.

##### Day 05

Tried a very naive bruteforce before attempting a tree based on the rules. In the end used simpler trees after filtering for relevant rules and then running a DFS.
